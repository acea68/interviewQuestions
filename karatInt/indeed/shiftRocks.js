/* given a board (an array matrix of any width or length). The characters on the board are:

'.' empty space
'*' obstacle
'#' rock

write a function that would move all the rocks to the right as far as it can go (an obstacle stops it).
Then as far down as it can go. Essentially imagine gravity moving all the rocks to the right, then straight down.
The obstacles stop the rocks from moving further in that direction. */
